## Aviator Game Guide

Aviator is a simple yet thrilling game where you need to cash out before
the plane flies away. Here\'s how it works:

### How to Play

-   **Betting**: Before each round begins, players place a bet. You can
    bet any amount, but it\'s advisable to start small if you're new.
-   **The Flight**: Once the round starts, a plane begins to ascend. The
    longer the plane flies, the higher the multiplier grows.
-   **Cashout**: The key is to cash out before the plane flies away. If
    you cash out in time, you win based on the multiplier. If the plane
    leaves before you cash out, you lose your bet.

### Understanding Multipliers

The multiplier grows quickly but can crash at any moment. This
unpredictability is what makes the game exciting and nerve-wracking.
